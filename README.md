Topology control of volumetric data
James Vanderhyde, PhD Dissertation, Georgia Tech 2007

Three-dimensional scans and other volumetric data sources often result in representations that are more complex topologically than the original model. The extraneous critical points, handles, and components are called topological noise. The key to this thesis is that the global topology of volumetric data sets is determined by local changes at individual points. 

In this thesis we describe variations on the local topology check for use in different settings. We use the topology simplification procedure to extract a single component with controlled topology from an isosurface in volume data sets and partially-defined volume data sets. We also use it to remove critical points from three-dimensional volumes, as well as time-varying volumes. We have applied the technique to two-dimensional (plus time) data sets and three dimensional (plus time) data sets.
